# Bash Modular Loader by Logan

This framework loads shell modules based on privilege level and context. It includes banners, wrappers, aliases, and plugins. All modules are documented and accessible.

## Philosophy
- Modular and expressive
- Privilege-aware
- Accessible to users with disabilities
- Safe by default

## Usage
Add this to your `.bashrc`:
```bash
source ~/bash-mod-loader/loader.sh
